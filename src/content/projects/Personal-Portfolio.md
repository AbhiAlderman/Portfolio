I wanted to make an online portfolio to showcase all the different interesting projects I have worked on. This also serves as my way to get better at FrontEnd development. This is where you are now! My previous portfolio used react, but I have since switched to Astro, as I do not need the full React functionality for my needs, and Astro has better performance. I used the Astro Melody template to get started working with Astro. Feel free to check out both Repos to see how I developed them.
